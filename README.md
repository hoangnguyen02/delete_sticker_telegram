# Telegram Sticker Remover Bot

This is a simple Telegram bot built using the `python-telegram-bot` library. The bot removes all stickers sent in the conversation.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this bot is to demonstrate how to build a Telegram bot using Python and the `python-telegram-bot` library. It serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in building their own Telegram bots.
Additionally, the bot can be used for entertainment purposes in group chats or channels where users want to keep the conversation free from stickers. By automatically removing stickers, the bot helps maintain a cleaner and more organized chat environment.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
   - pip install python-telegram-bot
3. Create a new bot on Telegram by talking to the `BotFather` and obtain the bot token.
4. Replace the `token` value in the `main()` function with your actual bot token.
5. Run the bot:
Copy code
python bot.py

## Usage
After starting the bot, add it to a Telegram group or chat. The bot will automatically remove all stickers sent in that conversation.
